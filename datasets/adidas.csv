Shoe and sportswear maker Adidas on Wednesday lowered its earnings forecast for the full year to account for losses from ending its partnership with rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, in response to the artist's antisemitic remarks.  

Adidas cut its sales outlook for the year as part of its third-quarter earnings statement, to a low single-digit increase from a mid-single-digit increase, and net profit from continuing operations to 250 million euros ($252 million) instead of 500 million euros.  

The company, based in Herzogenaurach, Germany, had previously said ending the partnership with Ye’s Yeezy brand would cost it 250 million euros. The Yeezy brand accounted for up to 15% of Adidas' net income, according to Morningstar analyst David Swartz. Adidas has ended the production of all Yeezy products and ceased royalty payments.

AKANightwing,adidas,"As a lifelong fan of Adidas it seems like everyone is against them rn. Either the right hates them because they dropped Kanye, or the left hates them because they took too long to do it. I'm personally of the opinion that they took too long to drop him, but I'm glad that they did at all. I'm not happy with how long it took but at least they did it. I never liked Yeezys for Kanye. I only ever liked them because of the designs themselves. So if Adidas continues to sell EZ's it doesn't bother me that Kanye isn't attached. It actually makes them better in my opinion.

I think the people that are upset that they dropped Kanye are looking at this purely from a Yeezy perspective and not from a moral one. The things he said were awful and should have never been something he got away with.

I guess my question is how do you feel about Adidas now that they've dropped him? Do you think that they can continue to be successful or is this going to affect there effect on culture?",Can adidas be successful outside of Kanye's shadow?,1668002349

shiningdragonneer,adidas,"Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the ""ZX0000 Evolution""? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

shiningdragonneer,adidas,"Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the ""ZX0000 Evolution""? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

Any opinions?",NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate,1666412885

shiningdragonneer,adidas,"Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the ""ZX0000 Evolution""? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

extranjo617,adidas," 

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

Any opinions?",NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate,1666412885

shiningdragonneer,adidas,"Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the ""ZX0000 Evolution""? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

extranjo617,adidas," 

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

shiningdragonneer,adidas,"Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the ""ZX0000 Evolution""? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

extranjo617,adidas," 

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

extranjo617,adidas," 

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

shiningdragonneer,adidas,"Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the ""ZX0000 Evolution""? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

extranjo617,adidas," 

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

shiningdragonneer,adidas,"Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the ""ZX0000 Evolution""? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

Is it normal for that type of material to get brighter as time gets by or is there something here the I'm missing?

extranjo617,adidas," 

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

extranjo617,adidas," 

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

extranjo617,adidas," 

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life.

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

3 weeks ago I pre ordered a dress from Adidas and was told it would be back in stock within 3 days of purchase. It did come back in stock and no sign of my dress. I have been contacting them for the last 2 weeks only to be told i'll be updated within the next 24 hours. Nothing. Over and over again I am being told the same thing and getting no where. I spent too much money on this dress but it was a treat for myself but right now I have no money and no dress to show for it. Customer service doesn't seem to care and I am no closer to getting anything. Does anyone know how I can escalate this? Has anyone been in a similar situation, if so, did it get sorted?

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

shiningdragonneer,adidas,"Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the ""ZX0000 Evolution""? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

shiningdragonneer,adidas,"Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the ""ZX0000 Evolution""? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

shiningdragonneer,adidas,"Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the ""ZX0000 Evolution""? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

Any opinions?",NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate,1666412885

shiningdragonneer,adidas,"Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the ""ZX0000 Evolution""? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

extranjo617,adidas," 

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

Any opinions?",NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate,1666412885

shiningdragonneer,adidas,"Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the ""ZX0000 Evolution""? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

extranjo617,adidas," 

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

shiningdragonneer,adidas,"Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the ""ZX0000 Evolution""? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

extranjo617,adidas," 

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

extranjo617,adidas," 

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

shiningdragonneer,adidas,"Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the ""ZX0000 Evolution""? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

extranjo617,adidas," 

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

shiningdragonneer,adidas,"Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the ""ZX0000 Evolution""? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

Is it normal for that type of material to get brighter as time gets by or is there something here the I'm missing?

extranjo617,adidas," 

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

extranjo617,adidas," 

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

extranjo617,adidas," 

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life.

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

3 weeks ago I pre ordered a dress from Adidas and was told it would be back in stock within 3 days of purchase. It did come back in stock and no sign of my dress. I have been contacting them for the last 2 weeks only to be told i'll be updated within the next 24 hours. Nothing. Over and over again I am being told the same thing and getting no where. I spent too much money on this dress but it was a treat for myself but right now I have no money and no dress to show for it. Customer service doesn't seem to care and I am no closer to getting anything. Does anyone know how I can escalate this? Has anyone been in a similar situation, if so, did it get sorted?

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

shiningdragonneer,adidas,"Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the ""ZX0000 Evolution""? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

shiningdragonneer,adidas,"Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the ""ZX0000 Evolution""? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

shiningdragonneer,adidas,"Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the ""ZX0000 Evolution""? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

Any opinions?",NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate,1666412885

shiningdragonneer,adidas,"Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the ""ZX0000 Evolution""? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

extranjo617,adidas," 

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

Any opinions?",NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate,1666412885

shiningdragonneer,adidas,"Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the ""ZX0000 Evolution""? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

extranjo617,adidas," 

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

shiningdragonneer,adidas,"Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the ""ZX0000 Evolution""? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

extranjo617,adidas," 

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

extranjo617,adidas," 

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

shiningdragonneer,adidas,"Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the ""ZX0000 Evolution""? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

extranjo617,adidas," 

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

shiningdragonneer,adidas,"Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the ""ZX0000 Evolution""? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

Is it normal for that type of material to get brighter as time gets by or is there something here the I'm missing?

extranjo617,adidas," 

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

extranjo617,adidas," 

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

extranjo617,adidas," 

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life.

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

3 weeks ago I pre ordered a dress from Adidas and was told it would be back in stock within 3 days of purchase. It did come back in stock and no sign of my dress. I have been contacting them for the last 2 weeks only to be told i'll be updated within the next 24 hours. Nothing. Over and over again I am being told the same thing and getting no where. I spent too much money on this dress but it was a treat for myself but right now I have no money and no dress to show for it. Customer service doesn't seem to care and I am no closer to getting anything. Does anyone know how I can escalate this? Has anyone been in a similar situation, if so, did it get sorted?

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

shiningdragonneer,adidas,"Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the ""ZX0000 Evolution""? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

shiningdragonneer,adidas,"Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the ""ZX0000 Evolution""? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

shiningdragonneer,adidas,"Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the ""ZX0000 Evolution""? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

Any opinions?",NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate,1666412885

shiningdragonneer,adidas,"Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the ""ZX0000 Evolution""? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

extranjo617,adidas," 

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

Any opinions?",NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate,1666412885

shiningdragonneer,adidas,"Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the ""ZX0000 Evolution""? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

extranjo617,adidas," 

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

shiningdragonneer,adidas,"Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the ""ZX0000 Evolution""? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

extranjo617,adidas," 

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

extranjo617,adidas," 

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

shiningdragonneer,adidas,"Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the ""ZX0000 Evolution""? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

extranjo617,adidas," 

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

shiningdragonneer,adidas,"Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the ""ZX0000 Evolution""? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

Is it normal for that type of material to get brighter as time gets by or is there something here the I'm missing?

extranjo617,adidas," 

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

extranjo617,adidas," 

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

extranjo617,adidas," 

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life.

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

3 weeks ago I pre ordered a dress from Adidas and was told it would be back in stock within 3 days of purchase. It did come back in stock and no sign of my dress. I have been contacting them for the last 2 weeks only to be told i'll be updated within the next 24 hours. Nothing. Over and over again I am being told the same thing and getting no where. I spent too much money on this dress but it was a treat for myself but right now I have no money and no dress to show for it. Customer service doesn't seem to care and I am no closer to getting anything. Does anyone know how I can escalate this? Has anyone been in a similar situation, if so, did it get sorted?

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

shiningdragonneer,adidas,"Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the ""ZX0000 Evolution""? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

shiningdragonneer,adidas,"Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the ""ZX0000 Evolution""? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

shiningdragonneer,adidas,"Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the ""ZX0000 Evolution""? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

Any opinions?",NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate,1666412885

shiningdragonneer,adidas,"Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the ""ZX0000 Evolution""? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

extranjo617,adidas," 

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

Any opinions?",NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate,1666412885

shiningdragonneer,adidas,"Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the ""ZX0000 Evolution""? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

extranjo617,adidas," 

Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.

I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.

I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.

shiningdragonneer,adidas,"Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the ""ZX0000 Evolution""? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.

To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed. 

The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.

SnooWoofers5193,adidas,"Hi all, couldn't find a post online about this so wanted to ask if anybody knew better. 

For the sale, I want to load up on a bunch of nice quality socks for basketball, been due for upgrade. 

https://www.adidas.com/us/creator-365-crew-socks/CK8483.html

On this page, if you click on different colors, you'll  see at the top the sport changes. It'll change from football, soccer, basketball. My question is, is there a difference? If I buy, say, the blue ones for football, are all the socks the same anyways? Theyre not optimized or customised for their respective sport? I don't wanna receive some super thick padded soccer sock or something. 

Thanks",Creator 365 socks sport specific?,1666536742
