1,Burned on the dunk drop today. So I‚Äôm just getting into sneakers and have bought several Jordan 1s available on nike and a pair of dunks from eBay and a pair of sb‚Äôs from stockx. Anyway saw the gym red released today at 10am my time. I loaded the page on time and picked my size and hit PayPal for payment method like I‚Äôve done with several other pairs and it gives me an error and says can‚Äôt process. So I‚Äôm like ok weird I‚Äôll just put in my card info and then it just had the spinning circle and won‚Äôt process. Is this the norm? Or am I just having shitty luck? Anyways I know I‚Äôm prolly preaching to the choir but just wanted to ask everyone is this is like a typical thing. Thanks for anyone who replies!
1,"Is there anyway to restore the grip on a pair of Air forces? I got a pair of air forces that I wear almost daily and a few months after getting them, the grip on the bottom of the shoes is basically gone now. Is there anything I can do to the bottoms to restore the grip back?"
1,"Anyone own the Nike Blazer 77 lows? Do they hurt your feet? Just purchased them and have a massive blister on only my left foot from the shoe rubbing on my fibula. Love the look of these but god damn i've never worn a shoe that hurts so much. The edge also hits the ball part of my ankle when I plant my foot down. Maybe I need to break them in but my left foot is getting smoked. I've worn them for 2 days now and the skin on the back of my left foot as burned off from the rubbing. Anything I can do to make them more comfortable? Is this a known issue with the shoes? I bought a size 12, I dont  *think * they're too big on me, but maybe that's my issue and why they're rubbing? I'm curious why only my left foot is getting the blister. Maybe I didn't tie that side tight enough. But i've tied them a few times since i've bought them, no way I tied it poorly every single time.   The only shoes I've worn for the past 5 years are adidas. Ultraboosts, alphaedge 4d, and NMD's are all i've worn. It just feels so insanely foreign to me to wear these new shoes. Totally different than the foam padding i'm used to. Surely it gets better right? Please let me know your guys' experiences with the shoes or any insights you have. Thanks in advance."

1,Recommendations for club fleece hoodie alternatives?  I lost my favorite hoodie of 2 years today and I‚Äôm looking to replace it. It was a Nike club fleece throw over hoodie that‚Äôs about $55. Sure I could buy another one but I figured I could use this opportunity to find a better comfortable black hoodie. I like the thickness of the Nike fleece hoodies if you‚Äôve ever felt it. I prefer this much more than say a classic champion sweatshirt which is too thick and rough for my taste. Any recommendations are greatly appreciated. I got a budget of $100-$200.

1,"How do you know if you are successful on your SNKRS order? Hi guys,  Around 10 am this morning, I was able to checkout on 2 shoes, the Jordan 1 zion, and the sb fruity pebbles. Both items were released at 10 am, I was able to check out at around 10:05 for the two shoes. We don't have an SNKRS app in our region so I used the Nike website. I always refresh on the product pages to check how fast the shoes would sell out, around 10:08 only a few sizes were left and around 10:15 it was sold out.  When I check the two pages again, a checkmark icon and a pending text appeared, and after that, they sold out.  1. How do you know if the order is on a first come first serve basis? I'll assume my order will get through and wait around 24 hours. Or I didn't win? There was no email or charges on my credit card. Is it possible my orders or order will be processed a few hours from now?"
1,"The Mystery of the Size 14s? Anybody ever crack the mystery of why Nike isn‚Äôt stocking size 14 is so many shoes?

Now I‚Äôm noticing it is moving over to other releases where Nike blatantly skips the size 14 and goes straight to 15."

1,"Nike SFB 6 2022 Hoping for any insight / review on these boots. I live in a Zone 6 so we get a decent amount of snow and plenty of days with single digit temps. I don't work outside but my job does require me to go outside for several 5-10 increments daily meaning I do need something somewhat weather resistant. Nobody likes standing around in wet socks.     I was eyeing the SFB6 as they look good to me and check off the boxes (boot, high top, prefer Nike), just hoping they will stand up to snow."
1,"Should I clean shoes before returning them to Nike? I know Nike has a pretty generous returns policy and as far as I know you can return shoes even after wearing them as long as it's within 30 days.  Well I got some shoes and wore them for Halloween and I'm not that into them, but they got a small bit of fake blood on them and some mud from the rain, nothing major but would that be an issue with returning them?"

1,Winter shoes Hello. Are there any Nike shoes that would be warm during the winter? The temperatures in my country during winter are usually about -2 to -8¬∞C (28 to 18¬∞F) but can sometimes reach to -20¬∞C (-4¬∞F) are there any kinds of Nike shoes that would be warm during this kind of weather?

1,"A friendly request regarding Nike posts about clothes... Just Don't Do It.     There's like a dozen posts a week with a random piece of Nike clothing, often older than 10 yrs, and OP wants to know  information  on said shirt or jacket or otw, and almost always there is zero replies.     It's a shirt.   It's a jacket.   What's there to  know  about it?  It's not  worth  more than you paid for it, unless MJ or Federer wore it themselves.      Even if you reach people that actually owned said piece of clothing, what could they possibly tell you about it?  serious question.    In the total history of Nike clothing, 50 yrs, not one piece of clothing has appreciated in value.  Not one.     An Exception might be if you are curious about a specific, unique logo,  or what sport's line it is.  I defer to my original point.  Who cares.  It's still just a shirt, or jacket, or hoodie.    If it was popular and sold well, and is older than a couple years, you won't be able to find it anywhere.    No retail company readily sells clothing from 3 yrs ago.    Ebay and thrift shops like Goodwill is your only chance.    But if you're actually really dedicated to specific clothing items, then you need to get out there and look yourself, regularly.   Footlocker, Nike, Dicks, Macys, etc.     It's hard finding GOAT clothes, even for people that constantly look.    Here's a GOAT tip, tho.   If you find the perfect shirt, shorts or even shoes, and I do mean PERFECT,    buy a second pair.  Hell, buy 5 pairs if you feel it's timeless (and you're done growing).     Put in the work, or just go buy something close when you go.    Nobody here wants to discuss a random piece of clothing.  They've made a million and they're making a million more.  They are worn and then they are thrown out.     That's how clothing works.    If you want to know the true value (which you already know), then put it on ebay and it's worth is exactly what someone will pay for it."

I just installed the app last July so I can only remember models released after July. Or do unique Jordan 1 low colorways get released in SKNRS only?  2. I recently bought the Jordan 1 Low Bordeaux which is my 2nd Jordan, I want to have colorways to match my new Jordan outfits ( Black, White,  Sail mostly Jordan Engineered stuff).

1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?  Thank you for any advice!"

1,"Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link]( for hiking and I am satisfied   I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general. This is a great lightweight shirt for sweaty people like me. I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.   &amp;#x200B;    The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for."

1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?  Thank you for any advice!"

1,Jordan 1 Low: Half-Size Down or TTS? Size 11 but the heel slips. Tried a 10.5 but my pinky toe feels like it‚Äôs being squeezed. Does it get more comfortable with time or should I just go with the 11?
1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?  Thank you for any advice!"

I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.   &amp;#x200B;    The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for."

1,I‚Äôm a size 8 in womens and I‚Äôm looking to get mens dunks but last time I bought nikes for mens it was Air Force 1s and the size 8 was big on me. My feet slip out the back when I walk. Should I get the dunks in a 7.5 mens? They drop on Friday! 
1,I wondered why every store I left the alarms went off. Anyone know what to do ? I bought them on vacation and going all the way back to the original store is not really an option. 
1,"Looking back, every store I left afterwards the alarm went off. Found it odd, and now I know why. Any help !? "
1,Jordan 1 Low: Half-Size Down or TTS? Size 11 but the heel slips. Tried a 10.5 but my pinky toe feels like it‚Äôs being squeezed. Does it get more comfortable with time or should I just go with the 11?
1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?  Thank you for any advice!"

1,"Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link]( for hiking and I am satisfied   I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general. This is a great lightweight shirt for sweaty people like me. I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.   &amp;#x200B;    The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for."

1,"Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link]( for hiking and I am satisfied   I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up.

I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.   &amp;#x200B;    The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for."

1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box.

I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?  Thank you for any advice!"

1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?  Thank you for any advice!"

1,Help finding this shoe So i need a new pair of winter shoes and i found these which i really like my the biggest size i can find is 40. Anyone know a pair of shoes that looks similar to these? I need them in 42.5.  &amp;#x200B;  Thanks :)
1,I‚Äôm a size 8 in womens and I‚Äôm looking to get mens dunks but last time I bought nikes for mens it was Air Force 1s and the size 8 was big on me. My feet slip out the back when I walk. Should I get the dunks in a 7.5 mens? They drop on Friday!

1,Jordan 1 Low: Half-Size Down or TTS? Size 11 but the heel slips. Tried a 10.5 but my pinky toe feels like it‚Äôs being squeezed. Does it get more comfortable with time or should I just go with the 11?
1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?  Thank you for any advice!"

1,"Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link]( for hiking and I am satisfied   I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general. This is a great lightweight shirt for sweaty people like me. I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.   &amp;#x200B;    The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for."

1,"Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link]( for hiking and I am satisfied   I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general. This is a great lightweight shirt for sweaty people like me. I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.   &amp;#x200B;    The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for."

1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box.

I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in?

1,"Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link]( for hiking and I am satisfied   I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general. This is a great lightweight shirt for sweaty people like me. I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.   &amp;#x200B;    The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for."

1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?  Thank you for any advice!"

1,Jordan 1 Low: Half-Size Down or TTS? Size 11 but the heel slips. Tried a 10.5 but my pinky toe feels like it‚Äôs being squeezed. Does it get more comfortable with time or should I just go with the 11?
1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?  Thank you for any advice!"

I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.   &amp;#x200B;    The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for."

1,I‚Äôm a size 8 in womens and I‚Äôm looking to get mens dunks but last time I bought nikes for mens it was Air Force 1s and the size 8 was big on me. My feet slip out the back when I walk. Should I get the dunks in a 7.5 mens? They drop on Friday! 
1,I wondered why every store I left the alarms went off. Anyone know what to do ? I bought them on vacation and going all the way back to the original store is not really an option. 
1,"Looking back, every store I left afterwards the alarm went off. Found it odd, and now I know why. Any help !? "
1,Jordan 1 Low: Half-Size Down or TTS? Size 11 but the heel slips. Tried a 10.5 but my pinky toe feels like it‚Äôs being squeezed. Does it get more comfortable with time or should I just go with the 11?
1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?  Thank you for any advice!"

1,"Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link]( for hiking and I am satisfied   I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general. This is a great lightweight shirt for sweaty people like me. I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.   &amp;#x200B;    The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for."

1,"Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link]( for hiking and I am satisfied   I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up.

I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.   &amp;#x200B;    The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for."

1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box.

I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?  Thank you for any advice!"

1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?  Thank you for any advice!"

1,Help finding this shoe So i need a new pair of winter shoes and i found these which i really like my the biggest size i can find is 40. Anyone know a pair of shoes that looks similar to these? I need them in 42.5.  &amp;#x200B;  Thanks :)
1,I‚Äôm a size 8 in womens and I‚Äôm looking to get mens dunks but last time I bought nikes for mens it was Air Force 1s and the size 8 was big on me. My feet slip out the back when I walk. Should I get the dunks in a 7.5 mens? They drop on Friday!

1,Jordan 1 Low: Half-Size Down or TTS? Size 11 but the heel slips. Tried a 10.5 but my pinky toe feels like it‚Äôs being squeezed. Does it get more comfortable with time or should I just go with the 11?
1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?  Thank you for any advice!"

1,"Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link]( for hiking and I am satisfied   I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general. This is a great lightweight shirt for sweaty people like me. I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.   &amp;#x200B;    The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for."

1,"Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link]( for hiking and I am satisfied   I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general. This is a great lightweight shirt for sweaty people like me. I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.   &amp;#x200B;    The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for."

1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box.

I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in?

1,"Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link]( for hiking and I am satisfied   I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general. This is a great lightweight shirt for sweaty people like me. I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.   &amp;#x200B;    The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for."

1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?  Thank you for any advice!"

1,Jordan 1 Low: Half-Size Down or TTS? Size 11 but the heel slips. Tried a 10.5 but my pinky toe feels like it‚Äôs being squeezed. Does it get more comfortable with time or should I just go with the 11?
1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?  Thank you for any advice!"

I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.   &amp;#x200B;    The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for."

1,I‚Äôm a size 8 in womens and I‚Äôm looking to get mens dunks but last time I bought nikes for mens it was Air Force 1s and the size 8 was big on me. My feet slip out the back when I walk. Should I get the dunks in a 7.5 mens? They drop on Friday! 
1,I wondered why every store I left the alarms went off. Anyone know what to do ? I bought them on vacation and going all the way back to the original store is not really an option. 
1,"Looking back, every store I left afterwards the alarm went off. Found it odd, and now I know why. Any help !? "
1,Jordan 1 Low: Half-Size Down or TTS? Size 11 but the heel slips. Tried a 10.5 but my pinky toe feels like it‚Äôs being squeezed. Does it get more comfortable with time or should I just go with the 11?
1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?  Thank you for any advice!"

1,"Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link]( for hiking and I am satisfied   I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general. This is a great lightweight shirt for sweaty people like me. I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.   &amp;#x200B;    The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for."

1,"Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link]( for hiking and I am satisfied   I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up.

I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.   &amp;#x200B;    The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for."

1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box.

I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?  Thank you for any advice!"

1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?  Thank you for any advice!"

1,Help finding this shoe So i need a new pair of winter shoes and i found these which i really like my the biggest size i can find is 40. Anyone know a pair of shoes that looks similar to these? I need them in 42.5.  &amp;#x200B;  Thanks :)
1,I‚Äôm a size 8 in womens and I‚Äôm looking to get mens dunks but last time I bought nikes for mens it was Air Force 1s and the size 8 was big on me. My feet slip out the back when I walk. Should I get the dunks in a 7.5 mens? They drop on Friday!

1,Jordan 1 Low: Half-Size Down or TTS? Size 11 but the heel slips. Tried a 10.5 but my pinky toe feels like it‚Äôs being squeezed. Does it get more comfortable with time or should I just go with the 11?
1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?  Thank you for any advice!"

1,"Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link]( for hiking and I am satisfied   I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general. This is a great lightweight shirt for sweaty people like me. I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.   &amp;#x200B;    The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for."

1,"Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link]( for hiking and I am satisfied   I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general. This is a great lightweight shirt for sweaty people like me. I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.   &amp;#x200B;    The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for."

1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box.

I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in?

1,"Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link]( for hiking and I am satisfied   I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general. This is a great lightweight shirt for sweaty people like me. I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.   &amp;#x200B;    The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for."

1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?  Thank you for any advice!"

1,Jordan 1 Low: Half-Size Down or TTS? Size 11 but the heel slips. Tried a 10.5 but my pinky toe feels like it‚Äôs being squeezed. Does it get more comfortable with time or should I just go with the 11?
1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?  Thank you for any advice!"

I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.   &amp;#x200B;    The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for."

1,I‚Äôm a size 8 in womens and I‚Äôm looking to get mens dunks but last time I bought nikes for mens it was Air Force 1s and the size 8 was big on me. My feet slip out the back when I walk. Should I get the dunks in a 7.5 mens? They drop on Friday! 
1,I wondered why every store I left the alarms went off. Anyone know what to do ? I bought them on vacation and going all the way back to the original store is not really an option. 
1,"Looking back, every store I left afterwards the alarm went off. Found it odd, and now I know why. Any help !? "
1,Jordan 1 Low: Half-Size Down or TTS? Size 11 but the heel slips. Tried a 10.5 but my pinky toe feels like it‚Äôs being squeezed. Does it get more comfortable with time or should I just go with the 11?
1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?  Thank you for any advice!"

1,"Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link]( for hiking and I am satisfied   I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general. This is a great lightweight shirt for sweaty people like me. I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.   &amp;#x200B;    The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for."

1,"Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link]( for hiking and I am satisfied   I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up.

I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.   &amp;#x200B;    The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for."

1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box.

I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?  Thank you for any advice!"

1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?  Thank you for any advice!"

1,Help finding this shoe So i need a new pair of winter shoes and i found these which i really like my the biggest size i can find is 40. Anyone know a pair of shoes that looks similar to these? I need them in 42.5.  &amp;#x200B;  Thanks :)
1,I‚Äôm a size 8 in womens and I‚Äôm looking to get mens dunks but last time I bought nikes for mens it was Air Force 1s and the size 8 was big on me. My feet slip out the back when I walk. Should I get the dunks in a 7.5 mens? They drop on Friday!

1,Jordan 1 Low: Half-Size Down or TTS? Size 11 but the heel slips. Tried a 10.5 but my pinky toe feels like it‚Äôs being squeezed. Does it get more comfortable with time or should I just go with the 11?
1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?  Thank you for any advice!"

1,"Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link]( for hiking and I am satisfied   I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general. This is a great lightweight shirt for sweaty people like me. I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.   &amp;#x200B;    The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for."

1,"Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link]( for hiking and I am satisfied   I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general. This is a great lightweight shirt for sweaty people like me. I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.   &amp;#x200B;    The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for."

1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box.

I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in?

1,"Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link]( for hiking and I am satisfied   I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general. This is a great lightweight shirt for sweaty people like me. I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.   &amp;#x200B;    The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for."

1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?  Thank you for any advice!"

1,Jordan 1 Low: Half-Size Down or TTS? Size 11 but the heel slips. Tried a 10.5 but my pinky toe feels like it‚Äôs being squeezed. Does it get more comfortable with time or should I just go with the 11?
1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?  Thank you for any advice!"

I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.   &amp;#x200B;    The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for."

1,I‚Äôm a size 8 in womens and I‚Äôm looking to get mens dunks but last time I bought nikes for mens it was Air Force 1s and the size 8 was big on me. My feet slip out the back when I walk. Should I get the dunks in a 7.5 mens? They drop on Friday! 
1,I wondered why every store I left the alarms went off. Anyone know what to do ? I bought them on vacation and going all the way back to the original store is not really an option. 
1,"Looking back, every store I left afterwards the alarm went off. Found it odd, and now I know why. Any help !? "
1,Jordan 1 Low: Half-Size Down or TTS? Size 11 but the heel slips. Tried a 10.5 but my pinky toe feels like it‚Äôs being squeezed. Does it get more comfortable with time or should I just go with the 11?
1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?  Thank you for any advice!"

1,"Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link]( for hiking and I am satisfied   I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general. This is a great lightweight shirt for sweaty people like me. I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.   &amp;#x200B;    The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for."

1,"Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link]( for hiking and I am satisfied   I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up.

I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.   &amp;#x200B;    The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for."

1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box.

I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?  Thank you for any advice!"

1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?  Thank you for any advice!"

1,Help finding this shoe So i need a new pair of winter shoes and i found these which i really like my the biggest size i can find is 40. Anyone know a pair of shoes that looks similar to these? I need them in 42.5.  &amp;#x200B;  Thanks :)
1,I‚Äôm a size 8 in womens and I‚Äôm looking to get mens dunks but last time I bought nikes for mens it was Air Force 1s and the size 8 was big on me. My feet slip out the back when I walk. Should I get the dunks in a 7.5 mens? They drop on Friday!

1,Jordan 1 Low: Half-Size Down or TTS? Size 11 but the heel slips. Tried a 10.5 but my pinky toe feels like it‚Äôs being squeezed. Does it get more comfortable with time or should I just go with the 11?
1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?  Thank you for any advice!"

1,"Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link]( for hiking and I am satisfied   I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general. This is a great lightweight shirt for sweaty people like me. I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.   &amp;#x200B;    The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for."

1,"Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link]( for hiking and I am satisfied   I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general. This is a great lightweight shirt for sweaty people like me. I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.   &amp;#x200B;    The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for."

1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box.

I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in?

1,"Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link]( for hiking and I am satisfied   I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general. This is a great lightweight shirt for sweaty people like me. I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.   &amp;#x200B;    The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for."

1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?  Thank you for any advice!"

1,Jordan 1 Low: Half-Size Down or TTS? Size 11 but the heel slips. Tried a 10.5 but my pinky toe feels like it‚Äôs being squeezed. Does it get more comfortable with time or should I just go with the 11?
1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?  Thank you for any advice!"

I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.   &amp;#x200B;    The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for."

1,I‚Äôm a size 8 in womens and I‚Äôm looking to get mens dunks but last time I bought nikes for mens it was Air Force 1s and the size 8 was big on me. My feet slip out the back when I walk. Should I get the dunks in a 7.5 mens? They drop on Friday! 
1,I wondered why every store I left the alarms went off. Anyone know what to do ? I bought them on vacation and going all the way back to the original store is not really an option. 
1,"Looking back, every store I left afterwards the alarm went off. Found it odd, and now I know why. Any help !? "
1,Jordan 1 Low: Half-Size Down or TTS? Size 11 but the heel slips. Tried a 10.5 but my pinky toe feels like it‚Äôs being squeezed. Does it get more comfortable with time or should I just go with the 11?
1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?  Thank you for any advice!"

1,"Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link]( for hiking and I am satisfied   I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general. This is a great lightweight shirt for sweaty people like me. I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.   &amp;#x200B;    The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for."

1,"Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link]( for hiking and I am satisfied   I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up.

I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.   &amp;#x200B;    The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for."

1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box.

I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?  Thank you for any advice!"

1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?  Thank you for any advice!"

1,Help finding this shoe So i need a new pair of winter shoes and i found these which i really like my the biggest size i can find is 40. Anyone know a pair of shoes that looks similar to these? I need them in 42.5.  &amp;#x200B;  Thanks :)
1,I‚Äôm a size 8 in womens and I‚Äôm looking to get mens dunks but last time I bought nikes for mens it was Air Force 1s and the size 8 was big on me. My feet slip out the back when I walk. Should I get the dunks in a 7.5 mens? They drop on Friday!

1,Jordan 1 Low: Half-Size Down or TTS? Size 11 but the heel slips. Tried a 10.5 but my pinky toe feels like it‚Äôs being squeezed. Does it get more comfortable with time or should I just go with the 11?
1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?  Thank you for any advice!"

1,"Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link]( for hiking and I am satisfied   I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general. This is a great lightweight shirt for sweaty people like me. I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.   &amp;#x200B;    The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for."

1,"Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link]( for hiking and I am satisfied   I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general. This is a great lightweight shirt for sweaty people like me. I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.   &amp;#x200B;    The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for."

1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box.

I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in?

1,"Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link]( for hiking and I am satisfied   I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general. This is a great lightweight shirt for sweaty people like me. I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.   &amp;#x200B;    The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for."

1,"Airmax 95 size question So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box.

I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.  My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in?

I'm personally of the opinion that they took too long to drop him, but I'm glad that they did at all. I'm not happy with how long it took but at least they did it. I never liked Yeezys for Kanye. I only ever liked them because of the designs themselves. So if Adidas continues to sell EZ's it doesn't bother me that Kanye isn't attached. It actually makes them better in my opinion.  I think the people that are upset that they dropped Kanye are looking at this purely from a Yeezy perspective and not from a moral one. The things he said were awful and should have never been something he got away with.  I guess my question is how do you feel about Adidas now that they've dropped him? Do you think that they can continue to be successful or is this going to affect there effect on culture?"

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life.

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life.

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life.

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life.

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life.

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life.

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life. I know it may sound silly that I'm freaking out about this, but I love rare/historical shoes, and this one always made me so curious and it just sucks that a lot of crucial information for this shoe has just vanished.   TL;DR - If you know of any ways to view deleted Adidas Confirmed articles, or know about what happened to the missing information for the ZX0000, please let me know!"

I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"NMD vs Ultraboost for Walking in Tropical Climate    Hi all. I've been spending a lot of time lately living/traveling abroad in Latin America, and since I don't have a car, I often walk for 30-60 minutes a day. For all of my life I've worn skate/basketball style shoes, but I've found that they make my feet hurt from all the walking.  I want something that's comfortable for walking but also stylish, because I don't want to pack many different shoes (i.e. something that I can also wear out on a date). It would be great if I could also use them for squats at the gym, but that's only a bonus.  I think I've narrowed it down to Adidas NMD or Ultraboost. The only hang up I'm having is that UB is open mesh, which means that my socks and feet will get soaked in any tropical rain. But I dunno, maybe that isn't an issue.  Any opinions?"

0,"Need Help With A Mysterious Adidas Model Can anyone help me find some missing information on an Adidas shoe called the  ZX0000 Evolution ? The shoe just released last year, but has a fascinating and mysterious story to it. You can find the basic premise of the shoe from websites that still have it for sale. But the deeper details of the shoe have seemingly disappeared from the internet.  To be more specific, an info dump of the shoe was posted on the Adidas Confirmed app that had a picture of the original prototype. From what I remember from that article, the OG prototype of this shoe had no specific name, was found in the basement of an Adidas employee's house, and only the left shoe was found. The best part was the picture that was provided in the article that showed that the 2021 release looked 1:1 with the single prototype shoe that was found. It amazed me that Adidas made the retail pair look so accurate to the original, but the problem is that I can't find that same picture anywhere, let alone the article that was on Confirmed.   The Confirmed article is gone completely, and no other websites have that same info dump that Adidas had on the app. The worst part of it all is that I can't find that picture of the OG shoe to save my life.

So my question is, has anyone experienced issues with V3s causing blisters on your heels?"

Some thin supercheap leather-like material is on the outside, but the overall impression: this tongue will break soon. It's fragile and feels as it can easily be tore apart. It feels like styrofoam. Styrofoam. Styrofoam. It also makes loud noise when walking.    These are not Gazelle's anymore, and with great heartache and sadness, I know this will be my last pair.      *just a rant"
