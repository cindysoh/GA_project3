Around 10 am this morning, I was able to checkout on 2 shoes, the Jordan 1 zion, and the sb fruity pebbles. Both items were released at 10 am, I was able to check out at around 10:05 for the two shoes. We don't have an SNKRS app in our region so I used the Nike website.

When I check the two pages again, a checkmark icon and a pending text appeared, and after that, they sold out.

There's like a dozen posts a week with a random piece of Nike clothing, often older than 10 yrs, and OP wants to know ""information"" on said shirt or jacket or otw, and almost always there is zero replies.   

It's a shirt.   It's a jacket.   What's there to ""know"" about it?  It's not ""worth"" more than you paid for it, unless MJ or Federer wore it themselves.    

Even if you reach people that actually owned said piece of clothing, what could they possibly tell you about it?  serious question.  

In the total history of Nike clothing, 50 yrs, not one piece of clothing has appreciated in value.  Not one.   

An Exception might be if you are curious about a specific, unique logo,  or what sport's line it is.  I defer to my original point.  Who cares.  It's still just a shirt, or jacket, or hoodie.  

If it was popular and sold well, and is older than a couple years, you won't be able to find it anywhere.  

No retail company readily sells clothing from 3 yrs ago.  

Ebay and thrift shops like Goodwill is your only chance.  

But if you're actually really dedicated to specific clothing items, then you need to get out there and look yourself, regularly.   Footlocker, Nike, Dicks, Macys, etc.   

It's hard finding GOAT clothes, even for people that constantly look.  

Here's a GOAT tip, tho.   If you find the perfect shirt, shorts or even shoes, and I do mean PERFECT,  

buy a second pair.  Hell, buy 5 pairs if you feel it's timeless (and you're done growing).   

Put in the work, or just go buy something close when you go.  

Nobody here wants to discuss a random piece of clothing.  They've made a million and they're making a million more.  They are worn and then they are thrown out.   

That's how clothing works.  

If you want to know the true value (which you already know), then put it on ebay and it's worth is exactly what someone will pay for it.",A friendly request regarding Nike posts about clothes...,1667720605

NPCwars,Nike,Size 11 but the heel slips. Tried a 10.5 but my pinky toe feels like it‚Äôs being squeezed. Does it get more comfortable with time or should I just go with the 11?,Jordan 1 Low: Half-Size Down or TTS?,1667278715
lsweg,Nike,"So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.

My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?

DarinBuchananki,Nike,"I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link](https://barforsupplements.com/NikeWomens)) for hiking and I am satisfied

 I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general. This is a great lightweight shirt for sweaty people like me. I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.

The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for.",Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt,1667071516

 I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general.

The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves.

lsweg,Nike,"So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box.

I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.

My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?

NPCwars,Nike,Size 11 but the heel slips. Tried a 10.5 but my pinky toe feels like it‚Äôs being squeezed. Does it get more comfortable with time or should I just go with the 11?,Jordan 1 Low: Half-Size Down or TTS?,1667278715
lsweg,Nike,"So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.

My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?

DarinBuchananki,Nike,"I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link](https://barforsupplements.com/NikeWomens)) for hiking and I am satisfied

 I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general. This is a great lightweight shirt for sweaty people like me. I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.

The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for.",Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt,1667071516

 I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general.

The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves.

lsweg,Nike,"So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box.

I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.

My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?

NPCwars,Nike,Size 11 but the heel slips. Tried a 10.5 but my pinky toe feels like it‚Äôs being squeezed. Does it get more comfortable with time or should I just go with the 11?,Jordan 1 Low: Half-Size Down or TTS?,1667278715
lsweg,Nike,"So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.

My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?

DarinBuchananki,Nike,"I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link](https://barforsupplements.com/NikeWomens)) for hiking and I am satisfied

 I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general. This is a great lightweight shirt for sweaty people like me. I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.

The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for.",Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt,1667071516

 I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general.

The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves.

lsweg,Nike,"So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box.

I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.

My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?

NPCwars,Nike,Size 11 but the heel slips. Tried a 10.5 but my pinky toe feels like it‚Äôs being squeezed. Does it get more comfortable with time or should I just go with the 11?,Jordan 1 Low: Half-Size Down or TTS?,1667278715
lsweg,Nike,"So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.

My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?

DarinBuchananki,Nike,"I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link](https://barforsupplements.com/NikeWomens)) for hiking and I am satisfied

 I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general. This is a great lightweight shirt for sweaty people like me. I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.

The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for.",Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt,1667071516

 I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general.

The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves.

lsweg,Nike,"So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box.

I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.

My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?

NPCwars,Nike,Size 11 but the heel slips. Tried a 10.5 but my pinky toe feels like it‚Äôs being squeezed. Does it get more comfortable with time or should I just go with the 11?,Jordan 1 Low: Half-Size Down or TTS?,1667278715
lsweg,Nike,"So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.

My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?

DarinBuchananki,Nike,"I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link](https://barforsupplements.com/NikeWomens)) for hiking and I am satisfied

 I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general. This is a great lightweight shirt for sweaty people like me. I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.

The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for.",Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt,1667071516

 I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general.

The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves.

lsweg,Nike,"So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box.

I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.

My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?

NPCwars,Nike,Size 11 but the heel slips. Tried a 10.5 but my pinky toe feels like it‚Äôs being squeezed. Does it get more comfortable with time or should I just go with the 11?,Jordan 1 Low: Half-Size Down or TTS?,1667278715
lsweg,Nike,"So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.

My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?

DarinBuchananki,Nike,"I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link](https://barforsupplements.com/NikeWomens)) for hiking and I am satisfied

 I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general. This is a great lightweight shirt for sweaty people like me. I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.

The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for.",Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt,1667071516

 I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general.

The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves.

lsweg,Nike,"So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box.

I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.

My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?

NPCwars,Nike,Size 11 but the heel slips. Tried a 10.5 but my pinky toe feels like it‚Äôs being squeezed. Does it get more comfortable with time or should I just go with the 11?,Jordan 1 Low: Half-Size Down or TTS?,1667278715
lsweg,Nike,"So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.

My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?

DarinBuchananki,Nike,"I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link](https://barforsupplements.com/NikeWomens)) for hiking and I am satisfied

 I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general. This is a great lightweight shirt for sweaty people like me. I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.

The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for.",Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt,1667071516

 I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general.

The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves.

lsweg,Nike,"So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box.

I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.

My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?

NPCwars,Nike,Size 11 but the heel slips. Tried a 10.5 but my pinky toe feels like it‚Äôs being squeezed. Does it get more comfortable with time or should I just go with the 11?,Jordan 1 Low: Half-Size Down or TTS?,1667278715
lsweg,Nike,"So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.

My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?

DarinBuchananki,Nike,"I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link](https://barforsupplements.com/NikeWomens)) for hiking and I am satisfied

 I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general. This is a great lightweight shirt for sweaty people like me. I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.

The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for.",Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt,1667071516

 I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general.

The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves.

lsweg,Nike,"So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box.

I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.

My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?

NPCwars,Nike,Size 11 but the heel slips. Tried a 10.5 but my pinky toe feels like it‚Äôs being squeezed. Does it get more comfortable with time or should I just go with the 11?,Jordan 1 Low: Half-Size Down or TTS?,1667278715
lsweg,Nike,"So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.

My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?

DarinBuchananki,Nike,"I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link](https://barforsupplements.com/NikeWomens)) for hiking and I am satisfied

 I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general. This is a great lightweight shirt for sweaty people like me. I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.

The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for.",Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt,1667071516

 I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general.

The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves.

lsweg,Nike,"So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box.

I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.

My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?

NPCwars,Nike,Size 11 but the heel slips. Tried a 10.5 but my pinky toe feels like it‚Äôs being squeezed. Does it get more comfortable with time or should I just go with the 11?,Jordan 1 Low: Half-Size Down or TTS?,1667278715
lsweg,Nike,"So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.

My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?

DarinBuchananki,Nike,"I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link](https://barforsupplements.com/NikeWomens)) for hiking and I am satisfied

 I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general. This is a great lightweight shirt for sweaty people like me. I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.

The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for.",Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt,1667071516

 I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general.

The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves.

lsweg,Nike,"So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box.

I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.

My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?

NPCwars,Nike,Size 11 but the heel slips. Tried a 10.5 but my pinky toe feels like it‚Äôs being squeezed. Does it get more comfortable with time or should I just go with the 11?,Jordan 1 Low: Half-Size Down or TTS?,1667278715
lsweg,Nike,"So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box. They also might be a little too snug for the width of my foot. I knew these shoes were on the narrow side, so naturally I looked for 14.5, but they only had sizes 14 and 15. I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.

My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?

DarinBuchananki,Nike,"I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link](https://barforsupplements.com/NikeWomens)) for hiking and I am satisfied

 I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general. This is a great lightweight shirt for sweaty people like me. I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.

The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for.",Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt,1667071516

 I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general.

The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves.

DarinBuchananki,Nike,"I bought this Workout T-shirt ([link](https://barforsupplements.com/NikeWomens)) for hiking and I am satisfied

 I‚Äôm a goalkeeper, so I put this shirt to the test and I have to say it kept up. It was comfortable and the material didn‚Äôt fuzz up. The shirt also looks good in general. This is a great lightweight shirt for sweaty people like me. I like to wear long sleeves in the gym both for modesty and to catch some of my sweat so I don‚Äôt leave it everywhere. I would call this a medium-weight fabric ‚Äî not as light and stretchy as Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúdry miler‚Äù running shirts, but not made for warmth/outside running.

The material is a little weird because it doesn‚Äôt stretch, but it does expand to fit your shape. Weird, I know. When I first got it and went to put it on I was super disappointed because it felt like it was going to be too narrow in the chest/shoulders and didn‚Äôt seem to have any give. And I have generally found that Nike tops always run a little smaller than I expect them to, but maybe it‚Äôs just my weird shape not being compatible with their styling. But after having it on for a while it seemed like it had stretched over time. Still a little snug if I pull my arms and shoulders back but looks great and is still comfortable. Makes me look more badass and in shape than I am which is always a plus. One downside with the weird fabric ‚Äî because it doesn‚Äôt stretch I couldn‚Äôt roll up/push up the sleeves. Not a huge deal except I‚Äôm used to doing it so I kept trying to do it out of habit and probably looked kind of stupid because it just didn‚Äôt work. Overall good for what I needed it for.",Nike Women‚Äôs Dri-Fit Fitness Workout T-Shirt,1667071516

lsweg,Nike,"So I ordered a pair of Airmax 95 essentials and got them in size 14. They fit just a tiny bit too small because my big toe slightly touches against the toe box.

I decided to opt for 14 because that‚Äôs my TTS fit. My index finger fits snugly behind my heel in the shoe, so my concern with sizing up is that they would be too big. It‚Äôs either that or hopefully break them in at the cost of being able to return them.

My question is this: Return them and go up a whole size to 15s, or if it is worth trying to break them in? Also, would the Ice method work to expand these or would it possibly ruin the bubbles?
