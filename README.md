# Project 3: Web APIs & NLP

## Introduction

Many fashion retailer launches new collection every season (4-5 times a year). Retailer barely have time to research and react on consumers' reaction and response on current season and another new season is coming. This short time frame, retailer have to analyse sales performance, marketing activation and execution.

## Problem Statement

As part of the commercial analytics team of Nike, we notice that it is a challenge to keep up with consumers conversation with multiple collections launching every season. Our stakeholder, Merchandise Planning department and Marketing department has tasked us to find a solution to help with their planning for the future season. The solution needs to be able to:

- Understand current competitor trend
- Understand current consumer response/comments
- Find out if the merchandise they had planned that would have high demand are accurate based on consumers comments
- Duplicated/reused for every season(dynamic/scalable solution)
- Differentiate Nike posts from competitor posts using a classification model

## Executive Summary

### 1. Data Collection

For data collection, we have use Reddit, as it has proper segmentation of different communities in subreddits which help ease our web scraping process.

Data standardisation:
Minimum 20 words in a post (title + selftext)
5000 posts from each brandâ€™s subreddit

Competitor selection: Adidas

#### Data Collection Process

- Create a function to filter post with minimum 20 words count while collecting the data
- Using https://files.pushshift.io to collect post and cut off at 5000
- Nike data was posted between 30 October 2022 and 10 November 2022
- Adidas data was posted between 22 October 2022 and 10 November 2022

Pushshift's API is fairly straightforward. For example, if I want the posts from [`/r/boardgames`](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames), all I have to do is use the following url: https://api.pushshift.io/reddit/search/submission?subreddit=boardgames

To help you get started, we have a primer video on how to use the API: https://youtu.be/AcrjEWsMi_E

**NOTE:** Pushshift now limits you to 100 posts per request (no longer the 500 in the screencast).

---

### Requirements

- Gather and prepare your data using the `requests` library.
- **Create and compare two models**. One of these must be a Random Forest classifier, however the other can be a classifier of your choosing: logistic regression, KNN, SVM, etc.
- A Jupyter Notebook with your analysis for a peer audience of data scientists.
- An executive summary of your results.
- A short presentation outlining your process and findings for a semi-technical audience.

**Pro Tip:** You can find a good example executive summary [here](https://www.proposify.biz/blog/executive-summary).

---

### Necessary Deliverables / Submission

- Code must be in at least one clearly commented Jupyter Notebook.
- A readme/executive summary in markdown.
- You must submit your slide deck as a PDF.
- Materials must be submitted before **26 Nov 2022 12 pm** through your GitHub account repo shared with the Teaching Team.

---

## Presentation Structure

- **Presentation Time: 10 minutes**
- Use Google Slides or some other visual aid (Keynote, Powerpoint, etc).
- Consider the audience. Assume you are presenting to a non-technical audience.
- Start with the **data science problem**.
- Use visuals that are appropriately scaled and interpretable.
- Talk about your procedure/methodology (high level, **CODE IS ALWAYS INAPPROPRIATE FOR A NON-TECHNICAL AUDIENCE**).
- Talk about your primary findings.
- Make sure you provide **clear recommendations** that follow logically from your analyses and narrative and answer your data science problem.

Be sure to rehearse and time your presentation before class.

## Rubric
Teaching team will evaluate your project using the following criteria.  You should make sure that you consider and/or follow most if not all of the considerations/recommendations outlined below **while** working through your project.

### Why did we choose this project for you?
This project covers three of the biggest concepts we cover in the class: Classification Modeling, Natural Language Processing and Data Wrangling/Acquisition.

Part 1 of the project focuses on **Data wrangling/gathering/acquisition**. This is a very important skill as not all the data you will need will be in clean CSVs or a single table in SQL.  There is a good chance that wherever you land you will have to gather some data from some unstructured/semi-structured sources; when possible, requesting information from an API, but often scraping it because they don't have an API (or it's terribly documented).

Part 2 of the project focuses on **Natural Language Processing** and converting standard text data (like Titles and Comments) into a format that allows us to analyze it and use it in modeling.

Part 3 of the project focuses on **Classification Modeling**.  Given that project 2 was a regression focused problem, we needed to give you a classification focused problem to practice the various models, means of assessment and preprocessing associated with classification.
