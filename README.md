# Project 3: Web APIs & NLP

## Introduction

Many fashion retailer launches new collection every season (4-5 times a year). Retailer barely have time to research and react on consumers' reaction and response on current season and another new season is coming. This short time frame, retailer have to analyse sales performance, marketing activation and execution.

## Problem Statement

As part of the commercial analytics team of Nike, we notice that it is a challenge to keep up with consumers conversation with multiple collections launching every season. Our stakeholder, Merchandise Planning department and Marketing department has tasked us to find a solution to help with their planning for the future season. The solution needs to be able to:

- Understand current competitor trend
- Understand current consumer response/comments
- Find out if the merchandise they had planned that would have high demand are accurate based on consumers comments
- Duplicated/reused for every season(dynamic/scalable solution)
- Differentiate Nike posts from competitor posts using a classification model
